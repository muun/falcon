## About

This is the source code repository for muun's iOS wallet. Muun is a non-custodial 2-of-2 multisig wallet with a special focus on security and ease of use.

## Setup

1. Install [golang](https://golang.org/)
2. Make sure you've set the GOPATH env var correctly
3. Install [cocoapods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html)
4. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
5. Make sure you have Xcode command line tools installed. You can check this in Xcode  > Preferences > Locations > Command Line tools
6. Run `libwallet/librs/makelibs.sh`
7. Run `tools/bootstrap-gomobile.sh`. This will install gomobile and bind libwallet to your GOPATH.
8. Run `cd falcon/app && pod install`
9. You're done! Open the workspace file and try building the project.

## Structure

The app has three layers:

* **Data:** handles the data backends, such as the database, the operating system, or the network.
* **Domain:** contains the models and business logic (use cases in clean architecture lingo).
* **Presentation:** contains the UI code
* **libwallet:** contains the crypto and bitcoin specific code. It's written in golang and bridged using gomobile.

## Auditing

* Most of the key handling and transaction crafting operations happen in the **libwallet** module.
* All the secure storage and data handling happens in the **data** layer.
* All the business logic that decides when to sign what happens in the **domain** layer.
